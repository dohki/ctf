`Balsn CTF` was held with `Cake CTF` simultaneously, and I participated in both 
of them as solo team. After playing `Cake CTF`, I was quite tired, so I decided
to solve only blockchain problems. Unfortunately, I couldn't manage to solve
`NFT Marketplace` problem till the end. It turns out that I had all gadgets in
my mind, but connected them wrongly. However, it was good to try
[foundry forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) for the first time.
